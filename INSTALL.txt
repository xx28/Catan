--------------How to Install----------------
1. To install required packages type "opam install lambda-term" and
"opam install lwt"
2. Run "make build" to build the source code, there may be a few warnings at the
beginning, but nothing to worry about.
3. For best performance, drag the top-left corner of the terminal to the top 
left of your computer screen.
4. Run "make play" to start the game
5. You can type "done" to begin the selection phase
6. Be sure that you click directly on the valid ">" or "<" which represent
nodes, also avoid scrolling on the terminal as this throws off the row/column
calculations
